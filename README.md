# ü§ñ Autonomous Maze Solver Bot (Right-Wall Follower)

Welcome to the repository for my **Autonomous Maze Solver Robot** project, developed using **Arduino Uno + Adafruit Motor Shield v1**, **IR sensors**, and a basic **right-hand wall-following algorithm**. This project represents my journey into the world of embedded systems, sensor integration, and autonomous robot navigation.

## üß† Logic Overview

### ‚úÖ Wall-Following Strategy:
- The robot follows the **right wall** using data from the front IR sensor.
- If a **wall is detected** (sensor value in calibrated range), it makes a **right turn**.
- If the robot turns right and again finds a wall ahead, it takes **two consecutive left turns** to backtrack.
- In case of a **dead-end**, the robot performs a **3-left-turn maneuver** to reverse.

### üß™ Sensor Calibration:
- **IR Sensor Range:** Obstacle detected when `analogRead(IR) ‚àà [400, 510]`
- Value may vary depending on lighting, surface, and sensor quality. Tuned via trial and error.

## üßæ Code Structure

- `setup()`: Initializes motors and IR sensor
- `loop()`: Continuously reads sensor and decides movement
- `check()`: Reads IR value and returns 1 if wall is detected
- `moveForward()`, `moveRight()`, `moveLeft()`, `stopMotors()`: Motor control functions

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Work

- ‚úÖ Multi-sensor setup (IR on front, left, and right)
- ‚è≥ PID-based wall following for smoother control
- ‚è≥ Maze mapping with memory and backtracking
- ‚è≥ ROS and SLAM integration for advanced navigation
 
- üí¨ Feel free to open issues or reach out with suggestions!
